                <p class="">Robert and his wife, Alyson, escaped the snowy winters of Chicagoland (Lansing, IL) and moved to sunny Arizona six years ago and haven’t looked back. Robert earned his Bachelor’s degree in Biology from Purdue University, then went on to earn both his Masters degree in Biomedical Science and Doctor of Dental Medicine degree from Midwestern University.</p>

                <p class="">Dr. Koch believes in a patient centered treatment model where he can educate and inform patients about their dental concerns while allowing them to feel comfortable in the decision-making process of their treatment. Knowing many find the dental office a stressful environment, he continually does his best to build patient rapport and ensure all of the patient’s concerns are addressed.  Effective communication combined with continually staying up-to-date with the latest research and dental procedures, is how he provides optimal care for patients. Robert’s ongoing involvement in professional organizations supports his commitment to dental excellence and allows him to provide the quality dental care that patients of Dental Studio 101 have come to expect.</p>

                <p class="">Dr. Koch believes in giving back to our community.

He has also taken his philanthropy efforts abroad and provided dental treatment to those in need for two weeks in Samoa.</p>

                <p class="">When not in the office, Dr Koch enjoys spending time with family and loves all Arizona has to offer. Robert has a supportive wife of seven years, a 4-year-old daughter and a 10-month-old son. Dr. Koch and his family enjoy swimming, hiking and going for bike rides. He also enjoys an occasional round of golf and rock climbing at AZ on the Rocks.</p>
