					porcelain veneers we can restore the natural look of healthy teeth without removing your natural teeth.

				<h3>Cosmetic Fillings</h3>

				<p>
					Almost everyone will experience getting a dental filling at some point in their lives and it is important that the type of material used for your fillings 
					is important. For years dentists have used amalgam material for dental fillings. However, amalgam fillings are not as strong or durable as materials available 
					today and we now know that the mercury found in amalgam fillings is potentially toxic.
